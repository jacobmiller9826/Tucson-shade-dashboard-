# 🌵 Tucson Shade Network

A community-driven web app to map and propose **shade infrastructure** in Tucson, Arizona — helping our desert city stay cool, connected, and livable as heat intensifies.

Hosted entirely on **GitHub Pages** and built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, this project is inspired by the idea that if Minneapolis can build tunnels for the cold, Tucson can build shade for the heat.

## ☀️ About the Project

Tucson experiences extreme summer temperatures and limited tree canopy coverage.  
The Tucson Shade Network visualizes **existing shade**, identifies **heat islands**, and allows residents to **propose new shade projects** such as:

- 🌳 Trees and pocket forests  
- ⚡ Solar canopies  
- 🏞️ Covered walkways  
- 🚌 Shaded transit stops  

This app is open-source and community maintained — anyone can contribute new data, design improvements, or educational resources.
